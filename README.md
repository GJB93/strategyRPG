# Strategy RPG

##Introduction

The aim of this assignment was to create a game. The type of game I chose to create was a Strategy RPG similar to games like Fire Emblem and XCOM. The key features of this genre are as follows:

  * There are two teams, a player controlled team and an AI controlled team
  * The teams take turns to perform various actions with their units
  * The player and AI teams both have the same number of units
  * The number of units available on the battlefield is limited
  * On the player's turn, they choose to move their units and perform actions based on their surroundings
  * Once the player has completed their turn, the AI will get the same options
  * The round/map is over once every unit on one of the two teams has been defeated

##Assignment Plan

My plan for this assignment is to implement the following features to the game:

  * At the initial stage of the game, the player is presented with six units to choose from
  * These units will have randomised stat values, and will be different for each new game
  * These stat values will determine the role that the unit will take
  * The roles will vary from a melee/close range fighter to a long ranged mage/magic user
